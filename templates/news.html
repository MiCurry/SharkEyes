                    <p> After 6 years of operation and development at Oregon State University, Seacast.org is shutting down!
                        Seacast.org has been funded by a grant provided by Sea Grant which is scheduled to end in the summer
                        of 2018. The development team is pleased and happy with the findings produced by Seacast.org and
                        value having the site as a service to the community.</p>

                    <p> Because of this, the Seacast team has teamed up with our friends at the Northwest Association of
                        Networked Ocean Observing Systems (NANOOS) to continue hosting Seacast.org. The new site has a new
                        look and feel and has all the same features and more including: data at the cursor, more tidal
                        locations, separated wind and swell wave heights and bathymetric depth contours. You can visit the
                        site at: <a href="http://nvs.nanoos.org/Seacast">http://nvs.nanoos.org/Seacast</a>.</p>

                    <p> If you have any questions or comments with the new site or the old site, please use the feedback
                        forms on Seacast.org!</p>
