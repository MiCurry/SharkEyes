<h2>About</h2>

<h1><span class="title_left">Seacast</span></h1>
<hr />

<p>
    Seacast delivers an easy-to-use interface for Oregon coastal fishermen that shows forecasted sea conditions for a three day period. The projections are determined using models provided by Oregon State University's College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS).
</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
    The forecasts displayed by Seacast are predictions only. They should not be relied upon for decisions that impact safety or commercial success. You, as the user, are responsible for safety-critical decisions made while using the Seacast website.
</p>

<h3>What Seacast Does</h3>
    <p>
        Seacast displays forecasts for currents, sea surface and bottom temperature, wave height, wave direction, wave period, winds, sea bottom temperature, surface and bottom salinity, and sea surface height. These conditions are <i>predictions</i>, much like weather forecasts, based on scientists' models. They do not represent actual, real-time readings of ocean conditions, although the models do incorporate actual readings to create the predictions.
        The Seacast website produces a visual display of these conditions, as image overlays on top of a Google Maps background.
        The models used by the site, like all models, have limitations. The Seacast team would like to receive your feedback about both the layout of the website, and the accuracy of the data displayed on the website. This will allow us to improve Seacast, and give feedback to the model creators about their model.

        </p>

    <h3>How To Use Seacast</h3>
    <p>
    Sea Surface and bottom temperature, wave height, sea surface and bottom salinity, and sea surface height are displayed as colormaps. Currents and wave direction are displayed as vectors (arrows). The arrows point in the direction of the field, and their relative length indicates their magnitude. Winds are displayed as barbs. Values for a specific latitude and longitude can be viewed with a right click on desktops and a double tap on mobile devices.
        The wave period model is displayed as a numerical value on the wave direction key. This value is the average wave period over the entire region for that day. The wave period for a specific location and time can be viewed by right clicking or double tapping the desired location.
        Turn the overlays on or off by clicking the toggle buttons in the menu bar. Right now color maps and vectors can be 'stacked' on top of each other. If two color maps are turned on at the same time, only the last one will be displayed.
</p>
    <h4>Note on Vector Keys</h4>
    <p> Both Currents and Wave Direction are represented as vectors, where the length of the arrow represents the strength of the current, or the height of the wave. Specific values of an arrow can be viewed by right clicking or double tapping the arrow.
        When using Wave Direction, it is best to use the Wave Height colormap as a guide to determine the most accurate wave height, rather than relying on the length of the arrows. </p>
<p>
        The model produces predictions for 4-hour intervals projecting out 2 - 3 days into the future depending on the model. Prediction dates/times can be selected by clicking the drop-down menu in the top left corner of the menu, then clicking on the desired date and time. The page will automatically refresh with the conditions for the chosen time.
        New model dates can also be selected using the Next and Previous buttons.

        Navigate the map, including zoom and pan, by clicking and dragging or using other navigation techniques used on Google Maps. Pinch-to-zoom on mobile devices should zoom in on the map.
        The menu can be hidden by clicking the "Hide" button in the top left.

        The overlays have keys that are visible in the bottom center of the screen. If several overlays are turned on at once, click the key to switch to the key for the other overlay.

    <h3>
        Purpose of Project
    </h3>
    <p>
        Seacast's purpose is twofold. It is intended to provide fishermen with an easy-to-use way to access the model forecasts, and it is also intended to allow scientists to receive feedback from the fishermen about the accuracy of the forecast models. The software development team aims to serve both these communities.
    </p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
    <p>
        Seacast is hosted entirely as a website, so users can navigate to seacast.org on their computer or mobile device. No download or installation is required.
    </p>
